# EchoForest - AI-Powered Acoustic Monitoring System

EchoForest is an AI-powered acoustic monitoring system designed to detect illegal logging in forest reserves. This web portal serves as the administrative hub for monitoring alerts, managing physical devices, and overseeing the operations of EchoForest.

## Getting Started

To run the EchoForest web portal locally, first start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the web portal.

You can begin customizing the portal by editing the files in `app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically refresh as you make changes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed along with a package manager like `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`. You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

## Features

- **Device Management**: Keep track of physical devices deployed in the forest for acoustic monitoring.
- **Alerts Monitoring**: Receive and manage alerts triggered by the detection of suspicious sounds that may indicate illegal logging.
- **Dashboard**: Administer and monitor operations, view system performance metrics, and stay informed of forest activity.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Set thresholds for sound detection to minimize false positives and maximize response accuracy.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live data feed of acoustic signals captured by the devices in the forest.

## Project Structure

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It uses the following key components:

- **Next.js**: The React-based framework powering the EchoForest web portal.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Next/font**: Optimizes and loads custom fonts including [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), the primary font family used in the portal.
